##  Raytrace

A raytracing version of the ray propagation model.

```@autodocs
Modules = [CoRaLS]
Pages = ["raytrace.jl"]
```

## Simulate_vector

Uses vector geometry and a mimimization routine to compute the launch angle that would cause the emergent ray to intersect the location of the spacecraft from a Direct or Reflected event.
